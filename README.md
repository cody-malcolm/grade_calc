# Grade Calculator

## Project Overview

To create an attractive, mobile-responsive page where a user can calulate their grade in a course based on customized weightings.

#### Learning Objectives

This should be mostly review, but I envision a fair bit of menus appearing and disappearing, which I haven't done directly before. Additonally, I'll want to add a sort of "save" functionality where a user can download/upload a .json so they don't need to re-enter the details for a class when revisiting the page.
